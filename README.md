# Welcome to Chex 3 GZD! test

## Chex 3 GZD is a fork of modern GZDoom (g4.10.0 and later) for playing Chex Quest 3 v2 with the original CD movies.

### The Windows XP/32-bit version (chex3gzd-xp, built from the "chex3gzd_3.87c" branch) is forked from LZDoom 3.87c, and supports OpenGL 2 and Windows XP for compatibility. It also runs on older non SSE2 cpus.
