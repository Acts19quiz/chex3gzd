			<p class="paragraph0">Welcome to the homepage for Chex&trade; Quest 3 and its engine, Chex&trade; 3 GZD! Here you can find relevant links, downloads, and even featured game mods like competitive multiplayer add-on levels. Check below for the latest news and updates.</p>

			<p class="paragraph0">The test server will be live soon at the scheduled time (6 PM Pacific, 9 PM Eastern, 2 AM London). You will be looking in OdaLaunch (included with <a href="https://odamex.net/">Odamex</a>; alternatively, you can use <a href="https://doomseeker.drdteam.org/">Doomseeker</a>) for the server name "<span style="font-weight:900">&lt;[IFOC] Server&rt; Chex Quest 3 v2 Co-op Test (Extreme Ooze)</span>". The address to connect to will be <span style="font-weight:900">192.155.90.89:10694</span>.</p>

			<p class="paragraph0">Mark your calendars: A public multiplayer co-op online test of the Odamex/ZDaemon port of Chex&trade; Quest 3 is now scheduled! It will take place on <span style="font-weight:900">Saturday, March 16, 2024</span>. The time will be <span style="font-weight:900">6 PM PST, 9 PM EST, 2 AM (SUN) London</span>.</p>
			<p class="paragraph0">What you'll need: The Odamex DOOM source port. You can get it at <a href="https://odamex.net/">odamex.net</a> (it's compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux). Odamex comes with its own server browser, odalaunch.exe, to find online game servers. You'll also need the original <a href="downloads/#Chex_Quest_1_(chex.wad)">Chex&reg; Quest 1 (chex.wad)</a>. Odamex should automatically download and load them when you join the server.</p>
			<p class="paragraph0">This will be a casual, sight-seeing playthrough of all levels to give players time to experience and examine everything. The difficulty will be "Extreme Ooze!" with unlimited lives. The expected play time of all fifteen levels is around two hours, give or take.</p>
			<p class="paragraph0">While I won't be playing the game, I will be in the Odamex Discord server, streaming the action, offering dev commentary, and fielding any questions people might have. Feel free to join the Odamex community and view the stream! <a href="https://discord.gg/3mKEnjx5P9">https://discord.gg/3mKEnjx5P9</a></p>
			<p class="paragraph0">When the test is done, all of the test WADs (for both the primary and Odamex/ZDaemon versions) will be uploaded here. The next step will then be a planning stage within the Chex Quest community to determine what (if anything) needs to be fixed, and how to proceed forward to finalizing alternations to make things ready for prime time.</p>

			<p class="paragraph0">A date for the public test can now be announced! Saturday, June 24, 2023 at 8:00 PM EDT, a test intended for the Chex Quest fan community will be conducted. It will be performed on the Zandronum source port. For more information on how to use it, <a href="about/#Multiplayer_Support">visit here</a>. You will be looking for a server with a name like, "&lt;[IFOC] Server&gt; Chex Quest 3 v2.0 Test". The IWAD will be "chex3gzd-rc4.ipk3".</p>
			<p class="paragraph0">The reasons for this test are for the Chex Quest fan community to experience the changes and new features, offer input, make suggestions, and find and report on any bugs. Fan input will be invaluable in determining where to go forward with Chex Quest 3 v2.0.</p>
			<p class="paragraph0">The pre-release test WADs needed to play will be made available at the start of the test. Configured correctly, Doomseeker, IDE, or your server browser of choice should automatically know where to look to find the WADs. They will also be made available here soon thereafter.</p>
