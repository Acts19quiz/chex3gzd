v27 THE WE'RE ONE UPDATE

-Merged both the GZDoom and Zandronum version into one, so now Zandronum
	players can play using the normal version.
	(The bots still work much better in Zandronum vs GZDoom, please use it
	if you can)

-Bots will no longer shoot neither friendly monsters nor players in co-op, and
	they also won't shoot players in their own team (in team-based modes).
	Yes, for real this time, and it works in Zandronum too.

-Bots can now follow players in Zandronum too, and they'll pick the closest
	player to follow online.

-Bots now switch between weapons they have in vanilla.

-tdbots_usenodes no longer needs to be enabled for following the player, or
	learning the map.

-Slightly cleaned up the TDBot_Main script (less duplicate code).

-Removed the ability for bots to seek items. The only place where this was
	even remotely useful, was in bot-only matches, other than that the
	map learning renders it obsolete, and it stops bots from eating up your
	ammo in co-op. This change was done as it was the only feature left that
	the Zandronum version didn't have, and it wasn't worth keeping the split.
